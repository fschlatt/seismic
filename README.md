Seismic is designed for effective and efficient retrieval over *learned sparse embeddings*.
Pleasantly, the design uses in a new way two familiar data structures: the inverted and the forward index.
The approach organizes inverted lists into geometrically-cohesive blocks.
Each block is equipped with a sketch, serving as a summary of the vectors contained in it. The summaries allow us to skip over a large number of blocks during retrieval and save substantial compute. When a summary indicates that a block must be examined, we use the forward index to retrieve exact embeddings of its documents and compute inner products.

The figure below gives an overview of the overall design.

Experimental results show that single-threaded query processing using Seismic, reaches sub-millisecond per-query latency on various sparse embeddings of the MSMarco dataset while maintaining high recall. The results indicate that Seismic is one to two orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art inverted index-based solutions and further outperforms the winning (graph-based) submissions to the BigANN Challenge by a significant margin.

See the paper [[1](#bib)] for more details.


## Experimental Results
We report here a comparison with other state-of-the-art indexes for sparse vectors. See the paper [[1](#bib)] for more detailed experimental evaluation.

### How to Replicate the Experiments

To run the experiments with Seismic, we need to compile the binary executables using:

```bash
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo build --release
```

This command produces three executables: `build_inverted_index`, `perf_inverted_index`, and `generate_groundtruth` in the `/target/release/` directory.

The `build_inverted_index` executable is used to construct an inverted index for a dataset. Both dataset and query files are stored in an internal binary format. Refer to the [Python scripts](#scripts) section for a script to convert a dataset from JSON format. This process involves several parameters that regulate space/time trade-offs:

- `--n-postings`: Regulates the size of the posting list, representing the average number of postings stored per posting list.
- `--summary-energy`: Controls the size of the summaries, preserving a fraction of the overall energy for each summary.
- `--centroid-fraction`: Determines the number of centroids built for each posting list, capped at a fraction of the posting list length.

For Splade on MSMarco, good choices are `--n-postings 3500`, `--summary-energy 0.4`, and `--centroid-fraction 0.1`.

The following command can be used to create a Seismic index serialized in the file `splade.bin.3500.seismic`:

```bash
./target/release/build_inverted_index -i splade.bin -o splade.bin.3500_0.4_0.1 --centroid-fraction 0.1 --summary-energy 0.4 --n-postings 3500 
```

To execute a set of queries, use the `perf_inverted_index` executable. Two parameters, `query-cut` and `heap-factor`, trade-off efficiency vs accuracy:

- `--query-cut`: The search algorithm considers only the top `query_cut` components of the query.
- `--heap-factor`: The search algorithm skips a block whose estimated dot product is greater than `heap_factor` times the smallest dot product of the top-k results in the current heap.

The following command exemplifies this:

```bash
./target/release/perf_inverted_index -i splade.bin.3500_0.4_0.1c -q splade_queries.bin -o results.tsv --query-cut 5 --heap-factor 0.7
```

The dataset of queries is in binary internal format. Refer again to the [Python scripts](#scripts) section for a script to convert a dataset from JSON format.

The executable prints the average running time per query. Queries are executed in single-thread mode. To enable multithreading, modify the Rust code by replacing the iteration on the query from `queries.iter().take(n_queries).enumerate()` to `queries.par_iter().take(n_queries).enumerate()`.

The results are written in the file `results.tsv`. For each query, there are `k` lines, one for each of its results. Each line follows this format:

```text
query_id\tdocument_id\tresult_rank\tdot_product
```

Here, `query_id` is a progressive identifier for the query, `document_id` is the identifier of the document in the indexed dataset, and `result_rank` indicates their rank in the ordering by their `dot_product` with the query.

To evaluate the accuracy of the retrieved results against an already computed ground truth, use the Python script `scripts/accuracy.py`:

```bash
python3 scripts/accuracy.py groundtruth.tsv results.tsv
```

This will output the recall percentage.

The ground truth for a dataset can be computed with `generate_groundtruth` as follows:

```bash
./target/release/generate_groundtruth -i splade.bin -q splade_queries.bin -o groundtruth.tsv
```

The exact top-10 results of each query are written in the file `groundtruth.tsv` with the format described above.

Even if multithreading is enabled here, the execution may take a considerable amount of time due to the brute-force exact query algorithm that scans the entire dataset for each query.

We provide a script to explore the search parameters given a trained index; the script is `scripts/grid_search_only_accuracy.sh`. You can use it as follows:

```bash
index_path=""
results_file_path=""
queries_path=""
gt_path=""

bash scripts/grid_search_only_accuracy.sh $index_path $results_file_path $queries_path $gt_path
```

The script writes the result of the grid search in `results_file_path`. To get the fastest configuration at each accuracy cut, simply run

```bash
python scripts/extract_results.py --file-path $results_file_path
```

### Download the Datasets

The embeddings in ```jsonl```  format used in our experiments can be downloaded from this HugginFace [repository](https://huggingface.co/collections/tuskanny/seismic-datasets-6610108d39c0f2299f20fc9b), together with the queries representations. 

As an example, the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Splade</span> embeddings for <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">MsMarco</span> can be downloaded and extracted by runnning the following commands.

```bash
wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/tuskanny/seismic-msmarco-splade/resolve/main/documents.tar.gz?download=true -O documents.tar.gz 

tar -xvzf documents.tar.gz
```

or by using the Huggingface dataset download [tool](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/datasets-downloading).

### Convert the Data

Documents and queries should have the following format. Each line should be a JSON-formatted string with the following fields:
- `id`: must represent the ID of the document as an integer.
- `content`: the original content of the document, as a string. This field is optional. 
- `vector`: a dictionary where each key represents a token, and its corresponding value is the score, e.g., `{"dog": 2.45}`.

This is the standard output format of several libraries to train sparse models, such as [`learned-sparse-retrieval`](https://github.com/thongnt99/learned-sparse-retrieval).

The script ```convert_json_to_inner_format.py``` allows converting files formatted accordingly into the ```seismic``` inner format.

```bash
python scripts/convert_json_to_inner_format.py --document-path /path/to/document.jsonl --queries-path /path/to/queries.jsonl --output-dir /path/to/output 
```
This will generate a ```data``` directory at the ```/path/to/output``` path, with ```documents.bin``` and ```queries.bin``` binary files inside.

If you download the NQ dataset from the HuggingFace repo, you need to specify ```--input-format nq``` as it uses a slightly different format. 

## <a name="code">Using the Rust Code</a>

To incorporate the Seismic library into your Rust project, navigate to your project directory and run the following Cargo command:

```bash
cargo add seismic
```

This command adds the Seismic library to your project.

#### Creating a Toy Dataset

Let's create a toy dataset comprising vectors with `f32` values. Next, we'll convert this dataset to use half-precision floating points ([`half::f16`](https://docs.rs/half/latest/half/)). Finally, we'll check the number of vectors, the dimensionality, and the number of non-zero components of the dataset.

```rust
use seismic::SparseDataset;
use half::f16;

let data = vec![
                (vec![0, 2, 4],    vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0]),
                (vec![1, 3],       vec![4.0, 5.0]),
                (vec![0, 1, 2, 3], vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
                ];

let dataset: SparseDataset<u16, f16> = data.into_iter().collect::<SparseDataset<u16, f32>>().into();;

assert_eq!(dataset.len(), 3);  // Number of vectors  
assert_eq!(dataset.dim(), 5);  // Number of components
assert_eq!(dataset.nnz(), 9);  // Number of non zero components
```

The following code shows how to read a dataset in the internal binary format with `f32` values and quantize those values to `f16`. 

```rust,ignore
let dataset = SparseDataset::<u16, f32>::read_bin_file(&input_filename).unwrap().quantize_f16();
```

#### Building and Querying an Index

Let's build an index using the above toy dataset and search for a query.

```rust
use seismic::inverted_index::{Configuration,InvertedIndex};
use seismic::SparseDataset;

use half::f16;

let data = vec![
                (vec![0, 2, 4],    vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0]),
                (vec![1, 3],       vec![4.0, 5.0]),
                (vec![0, 1, 2, 3], vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
                ];

let dataset: SparseDataset<u16, f16> = data.into_iter().collect::<SparseDataset<u16, f32>>().into();;

let inverted_index = InvertedIndex::build(dataset, Configuration::default());

let result = inverted_index.search(&vec![0, 1], &vec![1.0, 2.0], 1, 5, 0.7);

assert_eq!(result[0].0, 8.0);
assert_eq!(result[0].1, 1);
```

There are building configuration parameters to experiment with. Take a look at [build_inverted_index.rs](src/bin/build_inverted_index.rs) code for an example. 

The most important ones are

- `n_postings` in `PruningStrategy::GlobalThreshold`: Regulates the size of the posting list, representing the average number of postings stored per posting list.
- `summary_energy` in `SummarizationStrategy::EnergyPerserving`: Controls the size of the summaries, preserving a fraction of the overall energy for each summary.
- `centroid_fraction` in `BlockingStrategy::RandomKmeans`: Determines the number of centroids built for each posting list, capped at a fraction of the posting list length.

Refer to [Seismic parameters](#parameters) for recommended values for different datasets.

Take a look at [build_inverted_index.rs](src/bin/build_inverted_index.rs) and [perf_inverted_index.rs](src/bin/perf_inverted_index.rs) for examples to serialize/deserialize an index on a file.  

The signature of the `search` method is 

```rust,ignore
pub fn search(
        &self,
        query_components: &[u16],
        query_values: &[f32],
        k: usize,
        query_cut: usize,
        heap_factor: f32,
    ) -> Vec<(f32, usize)>
```

It accepts a sparse vector for the query (`query_components` and `query_values`), `k` for top-`k` results, and parameters `query_cut` and `heap_factor` for trade-off between accuracy and query time.

- `query_cut`: The search algorithm considers only the top `query_cut` components of the query.
- `heap_factor`: The search algorithm skips a block whose estimated dot product is greater than `heap_factor` times the smallest dot product of the top-k results in the current heap.

Refer to [Seismic parameters](#parameters) for their influence on recall and query time on the different datasets. 

## <a name="code">Using the Python Interface</a>

We have also included a Python interface for convenience.
It is fairly straightforward to build the Python interface with `maturin` as follows:

```bash
pip install maturin
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" maturin build -r
for whl in target/wheels/*.whl; do pip3 install $whl; done
```

Confirm that the installation was successful by importing `seismic`,
building an index, and querying it:

```python
from seismic import PySeismicIndex

# We assume that the sparse dataset is in the internal format.
index = PySeismicIndex.build(
    input_file,
    n_postings=3500,
    centroid_fraction=0.1,
    truncated_kmeans_training=False,
    truncation_size=16,
    min_cluster_size=2,
    summary_energy=0.4)
    
# You can serialize and store the index in a file.
index.save(index_path)

# You may later load the index to query it.
index = PySeismicIndex.load(index_path)

# Search can be done either for a single query. 
results: List[Tuple[float, int]] = index.search(
    query_components=np.array([...], dtype=np.int32),
    query_values=np.array([...], dtype=np.float32),
    k, query_cut, heap_factor)

# You may also (concurrently) search the index with a batch of
# queries. Assuming the queries are stored in the internal format,
# you can invoke the following function:

results: List[List[Tuple[float, int]]] = index.batch_search(
    query_path, k, query_cut, heap_factor, num_threads)
```
